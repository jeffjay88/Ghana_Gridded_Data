# Ghana_Gridded_Data
Gridded Station Data for Ghana


A monthly rainfall database (GMet v1.0), developed at a 0.5 × 0.5 spatial resolution, from 113 Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) gauge network distributed across the 
four agro-ecological zones of Ghana, and spanning a 23-year period (1990–2012). The datasets were first homogenized with quantile-matching adjustments and thereafter, 
gridded at a spatial resolution of 0.5 × 0.5 using Minimum Surface Curvature with tensioning parameter, allowing for comprehensive spatial fields assessment.

The data paper has also been attached to this repository for your perusal.
